# Fourth-project
PSD to HTML and CSS

This project was onother step up for me and actually at the beginning it was very difficuct because I didnt get any help as it used to to be in the previuos project. It took many times to go back and forward to HTML and CSS fundamentals (alement, attributes, properties, etc.) while I have got the result that is now. Unfortunatlly it is still need be improved.
